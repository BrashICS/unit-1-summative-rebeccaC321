<h3>What she did</h3>

<p>
    She made assembly language and the first assembler
With early computers you had to rewire the computer to create a program. 
But kathleen booth made it so programs could be stored in the computer as binary.
An Assembly language then translate instructions into machine code.

<h3>Assembly language</h3>

<p>
    instructions are changed in to machian code represented by 0s and 1s, loaded into some sort of storage.
</p> 



<h3>Impacted</h3>

<p>
    Early computers had to be programmed by flipping switches or unplugging and plugging wires into the correct place every time you wanted to make a calculation. 
    It was extremely slow and very easy to make an error. 
    Assembly allowed programs to communicate directly to the machine, making it far easier and making many things that would have been impossible, possible. 
    Without Kathleen Booth many advancements in technology would not be possible today.
